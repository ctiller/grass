# The memory state a transition acts on

The minimum state needed to decide whether a declared access is permitted: what
allocations exist, how big they are, what permission they carry, which of their
bytes are initialized, and which of them alias each other.

This is deliberately not the full M2 state. It exists because the seam cannot be
demonstrated without it — an operation's facets have to be consumed *by something*
that checks provenance, ranges, and aliasing, or the facet interface is untested
prose. What is here is what the vertical needs; the byte-level store, the
representation choice, and the framing lemma set remain M2.

## Aliasing is state, not provenance

`docs/MEMORY_MODEL.md` §7.5 contemplates mapping and sharing: a host-visible
device buffer, a file view, and a physical/virtual pair are distinct allocations
over the same bytes. Provenance cannot tell you they alias — that is exactly what
distinct `AllocId`s mean — so the state carries the relation, and the conflict
test consults it.

Without this, `Conflicts` required `SameStorage` and declared every aliased pair
non-conflicting: a write through a mapped view and a write through the file it
maps would not conflict, and every race-freedom theorem downstream would have
inherited that.

Write `bytes` at `start` in allocation `id`.

`initializes` is `AccessDescriptor.producesInitialized`: a completed write does
not always credit initialization, and `ByteStore` carries that per run so the two
facts cannot disagree. A write to an allocation that is not there changes
nothing; `performAccess` reaches this only after `denialOf` has found the record,
so the missing case is unreachable there rather than silently permissive.

/-! ### Framing

What a write does *not* change. `applyAccess` reasons by disjointness, and
disjointness is only useful with lemmas saying that everything outside the
written range survives. `docs/MEMORY_MODEL.md` §2 makes provenance the authority,
so the two axes are "a different allocation" and "a disjoint range within the
same one"; both are below. -/

/-- A write changes no allocation's metadata: extent, epoch, space, permission,
and liveness come back unchanged. `denialOf` reads exactly those five fields, so
`write_preserves_metadata` is what says a write cannot quietly widen what a later
access may reach. -/

One architectural fault that was raised.

`docs/MEMORY_MODEL.md` §8: "Architectural faults are modeled events/transitions."
A faulting substep that performs no memory access — a divide error between two
operand reads, say — produces no `MemoryEvent`, so without this record the fault
leaves no trace and a faulting execution is indistinguishable from a clean one.
That was true of an earlier transition, which took the fault as an argument and
dropped it on the branch where the faulting substep was not an access.

This is not the fault *model*. It records that a fault of a named class was
raised by a named context at a named substep; the ISA profile owns what each
class means, and `docs/SEMANTICS.md` owns how a fault reaches the program result.

The whole machine state a transition threads.

The three ledgers are separate because they answer different questions and have
different laws: memory is checked, obligations are transferred, and violations
only ever grow. `events` is the trace the consistency model of M8 will read.

  violations : AuditViolationLedger
  /-- The memory events performed so far, most recent last.

  `ValidMemoryEvent`, not `MemoryEvent`: the trace cannot contain a malformed
  event, so "every event in the trace is well formed" holds by construction rather
  than by a check something could forget. An earlier trace held bare events beside
  a predicate nothing consulted, and every event the transition minted violated
  it. -/

  Separate from `events` because a fault is not a memory event: it may touch no
  bytes, and `MemoryEvent` requires a location. Separate from `violations`
  because `docs/MEMORY_MODEL.md` §8 draws exactly that line — a fault is
  behaviour a specification may permit, a violation is behaviour
  `VerifiedProgram` proves never happens. -/
